// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning
 
// Correct order of the Software Development Lifecycle:
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which the application/software's requirements are determined. This is where developers figure out what exactly the software is supposed to do and what resources are needed to build it."
const design = "This is the third step in which a model is created to determine how the software or application will work. Some aspects of design can include User Interface, Platforms, Security. etc. A prototype may also be built at this stage."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step in which the plans are put into action. The developers begin building and writing the code/software that was planned in the previous steps."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which the created product is tested. This stage is important as it ensures the product is working correctly and as planned. The product is integrated at this stage as well which means it is made available for users. "
const maintain = "This is the final stage in which developers fix bugs that users may encounter with the software/appliction. This stage is also when developers may decide on releasing new features-- if they decide this, then a new Life Cycle begins. "
